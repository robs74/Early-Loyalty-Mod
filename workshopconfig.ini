This mod adds two ways of loyalty management in the early game.
1. Newspapers. Any secret police without vehicles counts as a newspaper. The recommended building is added as a dependency. Newspapers slowly increase loyalty up to 45% (modifiable in the settings.txt file: Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\784150\2963594887\settings.txt). They cover the whole map but the amount of workers they need to function properly scales with your population. By default, one editor can serve 300 citizens. People with at least basic education who are staying at home can read newspapers which increase loyalty and culture. Newspapers have a much weaker effect on citizens when radio or TV broadcasts are available.
2. Cinemas (buildings satisfying cultural needs in general) affect the loyalty of visitors. By default, it drifts towards the average loyalty of workers in the cinema, but not more than 50%. If you have built a secret police (newspapers do not count), the target is overridden by the average level of loyalty of your secret police officers as long as you have enough of them to oversee the workers in the cinema. By default, one secret police officer can oversee 5 cinema workers.
3. Increased the loyalty drift for schools, universities and orphanages slightly. You can also increase it for prisons in the settings file but it is disabled by default.

The mod uses objectives to show how many newspaper editors and secret police agents you need for 100% efficiency. Because of a bug in the current version of the game, it is not possible to update them without clearing all objectives. If you use my Useful Offices Mod, it will result in alternating objectives. If you do not like this effect, you can disable objectives in the settings.txt file. This bug is fixed in the next game update, so as soon as it gets released I will update both of these mods.

In order to activate this mod, click on the Scripts button on the left-hand side of the screen and then on this script. You can also turn the script off there.

This requires further testing and balancing.

Warnings: If you reload your game without quitting the game or at least returning to the main menu, the script will be duplicated. If this happens, simply run the turn off script until you are only running one instance.
