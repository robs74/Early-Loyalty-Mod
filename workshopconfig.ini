This mod adds two ways of loyalty management in the early game.
1. Newspapers. Any secret police without vehicles counts as a newspaper. The recommended building is added as a dependency. Newspapers slowly increase loyalty up to 45% (modifiable in the settings.txt file: Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\784150\2963594887\settings.txt). They cover the whole map but the amount of workers they need to function properly scales with your population. By default, one editor can serve 300 citizens. People with at least basic education who are staying at home can read newspapers which increase loyalty and culture. Newspapers have a much weaker effect on citizens when radio or TV broadcasts are available.
2. Cinemas (buildings satisfying cultural needs in general) affect the loyalty of visitors. By default, it drifts towards the average loyalty of workers in the cinema, but not more than 50%. If you have built a secret police (newspapers do not count), the target is overridden by the average level of loyalty of your secret police officers as long as you have enough of them to oversee the workers in the cinema. By default, one secret police officer can oversee 5 cinema workers.
3. Increased the loyalty drift for schools, universities and orphanages slightly. You can also increase it for prisons in the settings file but it is disabled by default.

In order to activate this mod, click on the Scripts button on the left-hand side of the screen and then on this script. You can also turn the script off there.
